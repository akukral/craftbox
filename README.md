# Craftbox
### A Vagrant "Craft Box" for Craft CMS
Craftbox is a simple Vagrant box running Ubuntu 14.04 and targeted for Craft development. Craftbox is intended for Craft developers (like me) that would love to have a simple Vagrant box that installs Craft and all their favorite development tools. Special thanks to Jalen Davenport for getting me started on this https://github.com/jalenconner/craftbox/

### Installation

1. Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/
1. Install Vagrant - http://www.vagrantup.com/
    * Verify Vagrant is installed by running `vagrant -v` in your terminal.
    * Install Vagrant Triggers for db import and backup `vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers`
1. Download Craftbox (choose one of the following ways):
    * Download and extract the GitHub repository - https://github.com/akukral/craftbox/archive/master.zip
    * Clone the GitHub repository - `git clone https://github.com/akukral/craftbox.git`
1. Navigate to the folder you just downloaded and run `vagrant up` in your terminal. Please be patient; it always take a little time to download and boot up the VM the first time.
1. Visit http://192.168.33.10 in your browser and you should see your Craft site.
1. That's it! Were you expecting more?

### Usage
##### Basic NPM/Gulp
Use `npm install` to install Gulp and package.json dependancies.

Run `gulp` to spin up localhost server with Browser Sync.
Run `gulp build` to compress js and css.

##### Basic Vagrant Commands
Start or resume your server - `vagrant up`

Pause your server - `vagrant suspend`

Turn off your server - `vagrant halt`

SSH into your server - `vagrant ssh`

##### Provisioning
I am currently using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to provision the box. You can find all the provisioning files in the provisioning folder. Vagrant uses the Vagrantfile to run a shell script on the VM that installs Ansible and starts the Ansible playbook. That way you don't have to install Ansible on your host machine.

##### Changing the IP
Craftbox is setup to use the IP address of 192.168.33.10. If this IP is conflicting with something on your network, you may change it in the Vagrantfile to the IP address of your choosing and then run `vagrant reload` in your terminal.

##### Development URL
So who would want to visit http://192.168.33.10 when instead they could just browse to http://craftbox.dev?
1. `$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
1. `$ sudo visudo`
1. Add the following to the end of the file:
```
# Allow passwordless startup of Vagrant with vagrant-hostsupdater.
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTS_ADD = /bin/sh -c echo "*" >> /etc/hosts
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -i -e /*/ d /etc/hosts
%admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOSTS_ADD, VAGRANT_HOSTS_REMOVE
```
1. Visit http://craftbox.dev
1. You can configure this url in the Vagrantfile.
1. That's it! Were you expecting more?

A big thanks to the wonderful [Vagrant::Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) plugin.
