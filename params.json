  "body": "# Craftbox\r\n### A Vagrant \"Craft Box\" for Craft CMS\r\nCraftbox is a simple Vagrant box running Ubuntu 14.04 and targeted for Craft development. Craftbox is intended for Craft developers (like me) that would love to have a simple Vagrant box that installs Craft and all their favorite development tools.\r\n\r\nDo you use Wordpress? Check out [Workpress](https://github.com/jalenconner/workpress), my Vagrant box for Wordpress development.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/\r\n1. Install Vagrant - http://www.vagrantup.com/\r\n    * Verify Vagrant is installed by running `vagrant -v` in your terminal.\r\n1. Download Craftbox (choose one of the following ways):\r\n    * Download and extract the GitHub repository - https://github.com/jalenconner/craftbox/archive/master.zip\r\n    * Clone the GitHub repository - `git clone https://github.com/jalenconner/craftbox.git`\r\n1. Navigate to the folder you just downloaded and run `vagrant up` in your terminal. Please be patient; it always take a little time to download and boot up the VM the first time.\r\n1. Visit http://192.168.33.10 in your browser and you should see your Craft site.\r\n1. That's it! Were you expecting more?\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n##### Basic Vagrant Commands\r\nStart or resume your server - `vagrant up`\r\n\r\nPause your server - `vagrant suspend`\r\n\r\nTurn off your server - `vagrant halt`\r\n\r\nSSH into your server - `vagrant ssh`\r\n\r\n##### Provisioning\r\nI am currently using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to provision the box. You can find all the provisioning files in the provisioning folder. Vagrant uses the Vagrantfile to run a shell script on the VM that installs Ansible and starts the Ansible playbook. That way you don't have to install Ansible on your host machine.\r\n\r\n##### Changing the IP\r\nCraftbox is setup to use the IP address of 192.168.33.10. If this IP is conflicting with something on your network, you may change it in the Vagrantfile to the IP address of your choosing and then run `vagrant reload` in your terminal.\r\n\r\n##### Development URL\r\nSo who would want to visit http://192.168.33.10 when instead they could just browse to http://craftbox.dev?\r\n1. `$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`\r\n1. `$ sudo visudo`\r\n1. Add the following to the end of the file:\r\n```\r\n# Allow passwordless startup of Vagrant with vagrant-hostsupdater.\r\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTS_ADD = /bin/sh -c echo \"*\" >> /etc/hosts\r\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -i -e /*/ d /etc/hosts\r\n%admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOSTS_ADD, VAGRANT_HOSTS_REMOVE\r\n```\r\n1. Visit http://craftbox.dev\r\n1. You can configure this url in the Vagrantfile.\r\n1. That's it! Were you expecting more?\r\n\r\nA big thanks to the wonderful [Vagrant::Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) plugin.\r\n\r\n### What's Installed\r\n\r\n* [Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS (64-bit; Trusty Tahr)](http://www.ubuntu.com/server)\r\n* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org)\r\n* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)\r\n* [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com)\r\n* [Craft](https://craftcms.com/)\r\n* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)\r\n\r\nView the [full list of packages](https://github.com/jalenconner/craftbox/blob/master/PACKAGES.md).   \r\nIs there something that you think ought to be included here?
